# Video_Games_Sales_SQL_project


## Introduction:

This SQL project aims to analyze a dataset containing information about video game sales. The dataset includes various attributes such as the name of the game, platform, year of release, genre, sales figures across different regions, critic scores, user scores, publisher, developer, and rating.

## Objective:

The objective of this project is to gain insights into the video game industry by analyzing sales data and other related attributes. We will use SQL queries to answer key performance indicator (KPI) questions and explore various aspects of the dataset.

## Dataset Description:

The dataset consists of the following columns:

Index: Unique identifier for each record.
Name: Name of the video game.
Platform: Gaming platform (e.g., Wii, DS).
Year_of_Release: Year of release.
Genre: Genre of the game (e.g., Sports, Racing).
Publisher: Company that published the game.
NA_Sales: Sales figures in North America (in millions).
EU_Sales: Sales figures in Europe (in millions).
JP_Sales: Sales figures in Japan (in millions).
Other_Sales: Sales figures in other regions (in millions).
Global_Sales: Total global sales (in millions).
Critic_Score: Score given by critics.
Critic_Count: Number of critics who reviewed the game.
User_Score: Score given by users.
User_Count: Number of users who reviewed the game.
Developer: Company that developed the game.
Rating: ESRB rating of the game (e.g., E for Everyone, T for Teen).

 
## Questions:

Q1. Regional Sales Analysis: How do sales vary across different regions (NA, EU, JP, Other)?
Q2.Genre Performance Over Time:How have different genres performed over the years? 
Q3. Publisher Analysis: Which publishers have the most games in the dataset,
    and what is the average sales performance of their games?
Q4. Which publisher has released the most games?
